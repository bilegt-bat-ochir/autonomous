# Step 4: Create your first application in APEX
## Objectives
- Explore the bundled features of Autonomous database.
- Become familiar with APEX.
- Create a machine learning model to identify customers that are likely to buy a certain product.

## Import application to your existing APEX workspace

Our starting point is an existing CRM application used by a fictional company. This contains basic information about our company's customers. The application is used by the sales/service employees of our company to look up details whenever a customer calls them.
First download the application that we will install. You can find it [here](./files/f100.sql). Download and save it as f100.sql. 

- Go to your ATP database and open the Service Console.

- I'd like you to browse existing data by clicking on arrow in on a row, and create a new customer by clicking on "Create" button. It's fully functional.

- If you go back to the newly created application, you can see how many pages are created in order to run this APEX application.
