# Step 6: REST in APEX
## Objectives
- Create your second workspace with an empty application
- Utilize RESTful service using GET,POST,PUT,DELETE methods from the second workspace RESTATP.

## Create your second workspace with an empty application.

-  You will follow same steps as we did in [step 4](step4.md). Logout from your current APEX workspace, and login as **ADMIN** user. When you are logging as **ADMIN** user, name of the workspace is **INTERNAL** and password is your database password which you have provided in ATP instance provisioning.
