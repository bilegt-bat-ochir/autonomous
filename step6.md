# Step 6: REST in APEX
## Objectives
- Define RESTful services in Autonomous database.
- Create an app in a second workspace RESTATP.
- Utilize RESTful service using GET,POST,PUT,DELETE methods from the second workspace RESTATP.


What is REST(Representational State Transfer), It's an architecture that provides interoperability between two computer systems using HTTP(s) protocol as a transport protocol.
Content usually represented via **JSON** or **XML** and great thing about REST is the two participants in the communication can be completely different in terms of:
  - Language (JAVA,.NET, PHP, etc.)
  - Database (Oracle, Microsoft, MongoDB, Hadoop, Couchbase, etc.)
  - Architecture (On Premises, Cloud, Mixed)

We will learn just how easy it is to build Oracle APEX apps utilizing RESTful Services.

## Define RESTful services in Autonomous database.

In this part we will utilize Oracle REST Data Servicea to get some data out of a simple user table in my WORKSHOPATP instance.
- Go to your ATP database and open the Service Console.

- Go to Development and open APEX.
