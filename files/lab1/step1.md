**Prerequisites for the workshop**

## Step 1: Request an Oracle Trial account
By registering for the workshop, your email address has been *whitelisted* for an Oracle Cloud Trial.

This means you will have **500$ in credit** for experimenting with a large variety of Oracle Cloud services, and you won't need a credit card to sign up.

For this to work, it's important that you:
- Use this **exact URL** to sign up for your trial: [http://bit.ly/OracleEstonia](http://bit.ly/OracleEstonia). 
- And use the **same email address** that you used to register for the workshop.

<!--Your whitelisting expires at the end of the day of the workshop, it's important to sign up before that to make use of it. -->

### Account Details
- On the next page you will be asked for the Cloud Account Name. This is what will uniquely identify your cloud environment. You will see it as part of the URL when you access it later.
- You will also be asked for the "Home Region". This is the location of the physical data center, I will choose Frankfurt region for this lab.

- At the end of this process, you should receive an **email** titled "Get Started Now With Oracle Cloud".
- To login to your cloud account, use the same email address that you used for registration.
- If you have to choose your identify domain, this is the same as the value that you chose for "Cloud Account Name" during registration.
