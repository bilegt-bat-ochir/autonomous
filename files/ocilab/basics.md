## Knowledge Check: IAM understanding
# What is compartment?

Compartment is tenancy-wide and across regions resource. It is a logical resource used for separating resources from each other based on different needs. Suppose you need to create separate compartments for your application team, database team, and networking teams from each other. Each of them can have different needs and different access level. [Refer to official oracle document](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm)

When creating a compartment, you must provide a name for it (maximum 100 characters, including letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, and underscores) that is unique within its parent compartment. 
*You can create subcompartments in compartments to create hierarchies that are 6 levels deep.

After creating a compartment, you need to write at least one policy for it, otherwise no one can access to given compartment.

### What is policy? 

### What is group? 

### What is user? 


## Step 1: Login to the your account for the first time

After your cloud account creation, you will receive confirmation email:

Click on the blue "Sign In to Oracle Cloud" button in email, which will take you to login window, then click on the **Sign in** link.

When you sign in to the Console, the dashboard is displayed.

You will notice something in address bar. OCI generates region specific login addresses and each tenants should use correct link.
In my case, ap-tokyo-1, which means my region is Japan and data center is in Tokyo.
